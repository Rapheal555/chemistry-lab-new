# 🧪 Virtual Chemistry Lab - Separation Techniques

An interactive 3D virtual chemistry laboratory designed for high school students to learn and practice separation techniques without the need for physical equipment or chemicals.

## 🎯 Educational Purpose

This application serves as a safe, accessible alternative to a physical chemistry lab, allowing students to:

- **Experiment freely** without safety risks or material costs
- **Understand scientific principles** through interactive visualization
- **Practice lab techniques** in a realistic 3D environment
- **Learn at their own pace** with guided instructions and tooltips
- **Observe cause and effect** by adjusting parameters in real-time

## 🔬 Available Separation Techniques

### Currently Implemented:

1. **Filtration** - Separate solid particles from liquids using porous barriers
2. **Distillation** - Separate liquids based on differences in boiling points

### Coming Soon:

3. Chromatography - Separate based on affinity to phases
4. Centrifugation - Separate based on density using centrifugal force
5. Decantation - Pour off liquid layers
6. Sublimation - Separate via solid-to-gas transition
7. Liquid-Liquid Extraction - Transfer solutes between solvents
