# 🧪 How to Perform a Filtration Experiment

## Quick Start Guide for Students

### What You'll Do

Separate a solid from a liquid using filtration - just like in a real chemistry lab!

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. **Choose Your Compounds** 📝

Pick one solid and one liquid to mix:

#### Solid Options:

- 🟤 **Sand** - Easy to filter, large particles
- ⚪ **Chalk Powder** - Medium difficulty, forms cake
- ⚫ **Coffee Grounds** - Medium particles, realistic
- 🟫 **Clay** - Very fine, slow to filter (challenging!)

#### Liquid Options:

- 💧 **Water** - Fast flow, low viscosity
- 🌊 **Salt Water** - Similar to water
- 🌟 **Cooking Oil** - Slow flow, high viscosity

**💡 Tip**: Start with Sand + Water for your first try!

---

### 2. **Mix the Compounds** 🥄

1. Click the **"🥄 Mix Compounds"** button
2. Watch the progress bar fill up
3. See your mixture appear in the beaker on the lab bench
4. Wait for mixing to complete (takes a few seconds)

---

### 3. **Get Ready to Pour** ✅

Before pouring, check:

- ✓ Filter paper is in the funnel
- ✓ Vacuum is connected (if using)
- ✓ Collection flask is ready
- ✓ You're ready to observe!

Click **"🫗 Pour Mixture into Filter"** when ready

---

### 4. **Watch the Filtration** ⏳

Once poured, the filtration starts automatically!

**What to Observe:**

- 👀 Liquid level going down in the funnel
- 💧 Clear liquid collecting in the flask below
- 🥞 Solid particles building up on the filter paper
- ⏱️ How fast or slow it filters

**In the Right Panel:**

- See percentage of liquid filtered
- Watch filtrate collection progress
- Read real-time observations

---

### 5. **Filtration Complete!** 🎉

When finished, you'll see:

- ✅ "Filtration Complete!" message
- Separated solid (residue) on filter
- Clear liquid (filtrate) in flask

**What Happened:**

- **Residue**: The solid you chose (stayed on filter)
- **Filtrate**: The liquid you chose (passed through)

---

## Adjusting Equipment Settings ⚙️

Want to change how fast it filters? Adjust these:

### Filter Pore Size

- **Smaller** = Catches finer particles but SLOWER
- **Larger** = Faster but may miss small particles
- Try: 5-50 µm

### Vacuum Pressure

- **No vacuum (0)** = Gravity only, SLOW
- **High vacuum (500-1000)** = Much FASTER
- Try: 300 mbar to start

### Other Factors:

- **Viscosity**: Set by which liquid you choose
- **Filter Area**: Larger = faster (like a bigger funnel)

---

## Try These Experiments

### Experiment 1: Speed Test

- Use Sand + Water
- Try vacuum at 0, then 500, then 1000
- **Question**: How much faster with vacuum?

### Experiment 2: Pore Size

- Use Chalk + Water
- Try pore size at 5, then 20, then 50
- **Question**: Which is fastest? Which catches more?

### Experiment 3: Viscosity Challenge

- Compare Water vs Oil (with same solid)
- **Question**: Why is oil slower?

### Experiment 4: Particle Size

- Try Sand, then Clay (both with water)
- **Question**: Which takes longer? Why?

## What to Write in Your Notes

📓 **Record These Observations:**

1. What compounds did you choose?
2. What equipment settings did you use?
3. How long did filtration take?
4. What did you see happening?
5. What ended up on the filter?
6. What ended up in the flask?
7. Was the filtrate clear?
8. What would you change next time?

---

## Troubleshooting

### ❓ "Nothing is happening!"

- Did you select BOTH a solid and liquid?
- Did you click "Mix Compounds"?
- Did you click "Pour Mixture"?

### ❓ "It's too slow!"

- Increase the vacuum pressure
- Increase the pore size
- Use a less viscous liquid

### ❓ "It's too fast!"

- Decrease the vacuum pressure
- Decrease the pore size
- This might mean your settings are very efficient!

### ❓ "I want to start over"

- Click **"🔄 Start New Experiment"** button
- Choose new compounds and try again!

## Safety Reminders 🛡️

Even though this is virtual, think about real lab safety:

- 🥽 In a real lab, you'd wear goggles
- 🥼 You'd wear a lab coat
- 🧤 Use gloves when handling chemicals
- 📋 Always read instructions first
- 🚫 Never eat or drink in a lab
- 👨‍🏫 Ask your teacher if unsure

---

## Learning Objectives ✓

By doing this experiment, you should understand:

1. ✓ **What filtration is**: Separating solid from liquid
2. ✓ **How it works**: Porous filter lets liquid through
3. ✓ **Key variables**: Pore size, pressure, viscosity
4. ✓ **Applications**: Coffee, water purification, etc.
5. ✓ **Lab procedure**: Step-by-step scientific method

---

## Real-World Examples

Where do we use filtration?

- ☕ **Coffee Maker**: Filters grounds from coffee
- 💧 **Water Filter**: Removes particles from tap water
- 🚗 **Car Engine**: Oil filter removes dirt
- 🏊 **Swimming Pool**: Filters debris from water
- 🏭 **Industry**: Separates products from waste
- 🩺 **Kidneys**: Filter waste from blood!

---

## Questions to Think About

1. Why does smaller pore size make filtration slower?
2. How does vacuum help speed up the process?
3. What happens if particles are smaller than the pores?
4. Why does the filter cake get thicker over time?
5. Would filtration work to separate two liquids? Why not?
