- ✓ Plan for different completion speeds

### During Lab:

- ✓ Circulate and observe student work
- ✓ Ask guiding questions, don't give answers
- ✓ Encourage hypothesis testing
- ✓ Have students explain their reasoning
- ✓ Pause for mini-lessons as needed
- ✓ Take photos of good observations

### After Lab:

- ✓ Debrief as a class
- ✓ Discuss common misconceptions
- ✓ Connect to real-world applications
- ✓ Assign reflection writing
- ✓ Assess understanding

### Common Student Questions:

**Q: "Why isn't anything happening?"**
A: Check if parameters are set appropriately. Try increasing heat/vacuum.

**Q: "Is this how it really works?"**
A: The principles are accurate, but simplified for learning. Real lab is messier!

**Q: "Can I break anything?"**
A: No! Experiment freely. That's the beauty of virtual labs.

**Q: "Why is this taking so long?"**
A: Just like real lab! Some processes are slow. Adjust parameters to speed up.
