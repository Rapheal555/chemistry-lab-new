00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Step 7. Completion of distillation.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,340
The distillation process continues until all of the desired substance has been vaporized

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,920
and condensed into the receiving flask.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,480
The substance remaining in the distillation flask, which has a higher boiling point, is

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,160
called the residue or the still bottom.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,440
By carefully controlling the temperature and collecting the distillate at the appropriate

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,320
boiling point, we can separate and purify the desired substance from a mixture using

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,400
the distillation apparatus.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,920
This method is widely used for various purposes, such as purifying water, perfumery and the

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,400
production of essential oils.
