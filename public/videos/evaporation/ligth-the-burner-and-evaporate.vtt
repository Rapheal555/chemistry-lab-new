00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
When we light the burner, it heats up the solution.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This causes the solvent portion, the liquid water, to change its state from a liquid to a gas called water vapor, a process called evaporation.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Notice the level of water decreasing as more and more water evaporates into the air.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
When all of the water has evaporated, it leaves behind the solute, the dissolved salt.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So in summary, dissolving salt in warm water creates a solution by evenly distributing the solid solute in the liquid solvent.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And heating that solution causes evaporation, which separates out the solute by removing the solvent.
