00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Let's add a teaspoonful of salt to the warm water and give it a stir.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,880
As we stir, notice how the salt grains are slowly disappearing in the water.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,320
This is happening because the salt is dissolving and becoming part of the water to form a saltwater

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,320
solution.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,400
A solution is when a solid completely mixes and spreads out evenly into a liquid.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,200
In a solution, the liquid portion is called the solvent.

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,440
In this case, water is the solvent.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,320
And the dissolved solid is known as the solute.

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,560
Here, the salt is the solute.
