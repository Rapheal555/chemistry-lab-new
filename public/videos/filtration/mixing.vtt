00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,720
Let's make a mixture by pouring the sand into the beaker and giving it a stir.

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,400
Now we have a mixture of sand and water.

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,880
How can we separate the mixture back to its original components?

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,640
When we have a mixture of a solid and a liquid, we can separate the mixture using a technique

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,640
called filtration.
