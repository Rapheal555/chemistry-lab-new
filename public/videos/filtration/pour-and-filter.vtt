00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
When you pour the mixture over the filter paper in a funnel,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
the liquid can pass through the holes.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
But the solid pieces are too big to fit through

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
so they get trapped in the filter paper.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's see this in action.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Great! The mixture has been separated.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The solid matter, the sand, is held by the filter paper.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We call this the solid residue.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The liquid, in this case water, passed through the filter paper.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What's left in the beaker is just the water which we call the filtrate.
